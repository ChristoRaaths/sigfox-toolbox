# Node-RED blocks for communicating with the SIGFOX backend API

This repository contains Node-RED blocks for communicating with the SIGFOX
backend API. SIGFOX backend is a web service for managing information about
devices present in the SIGFOX network and accessing packet data sent over the
network.

## How to install

Copy the contents of the `sigfox-in` and `sigfox-device-filter` directories
into one of the directories where Node-RED searches for nodes. For example
(assuming Node-RED has been installed under `~/node_modules`):

    $ cd node-red-sigfox-web-api
    $ mkdir ~/node_modules/node-red/nodes/sigfox
    $ cp -a sigfox-* ~/node_modules/node-red/nodes/sigfox

After copying the files, you should restart Node-RED.

## How to use

After installation, two new nodes should appear under the *sigfox* category in
the Node-RED editor toolbox:

 *  `sigfox-in` - Accept callbacks from the SIGFOX backend API. For each
    received packet, this block emits a JSON object containing all information
    about the packet provided by the backend.

    In the node settings, set the *Device type ID* field to the ID shown on the
    *Device Type* tab of the SIGFOX backend interface.

 *  `sigfox-device-filter` - This block can be used to filter the received
    packet callbacks, as emitted by the `sigfox-in` node, by SIGFOX device ID.

    In node settings, set the *Device* field to the *Device Id*, as shown on the
    *Device* tab of the SIGFOX backend interface.

    This ID is sometimes also shown on the device itself (5 to 6 hexadecimal
    numbers).

Before the `sigfox-in` node will begin receiving callbacks, the appropriate
callback configuration has to be entered into the SIGFOX backend interface.
This configuration can be found under *Device Type - Callbacks* tab. The
computer running Node-RED must have a static, publicly accessible IP.

The screenshot below shows the correct configuration.

The *Url pattern* field must be of the following format:

    http://host:port/sigfox/callback/deviceTypeId

where *host* is the host running Node-RED with the `sigfox-in` block, *port* is
the port running the Node-RED editor (1880 by default) and *deviceTypeId* is
the Device type ID entered in the `sigfox-in` node settings.
